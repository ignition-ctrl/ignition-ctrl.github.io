So, yeah, I haven't posted in a month. If anyone's following this, (which I doubt), I've been busy with other things. I have, though, got some new things set up on my server.
Welcome to Nullboard! <a href="https://nullboard.io/preview">Link</a>
It's really quite cool. Check out its Github.
It's a small noteboard made by <a href="https://github.com/apankrat">Alexander Pankratov</a>
It works very well as a kanboard, and it's all in localstorage so you can self host it. 
On my Mac, I have it running on localhost:80 and there's a dockerized version on my server (board.deepdepths.online). Though, the localstorage feature is annoying if you're using multiple devices. There is also a auto-backup feature, but only for Windows. I'm sure though it's not too hard to develop for Linux. It seems to consist of a few api calls. I'd love to try working on it, but the html file has a lot of JS and CSS that I'm not experienced enough to understand. (Who uses letter variables?? Just kidding, I know its a higher level of thinking).
In other news, I'm starting to learn Go.
I'll try to post more often. 
Also, I might add Disqus if there are any readers.
