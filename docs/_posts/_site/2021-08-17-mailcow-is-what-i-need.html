<h1>Mailcow Is What I Need!</h1>
<p>Good morning, everyone. So, I forgot to post yesterday again. I spent all day at the Big Apple. Very fun, there’s a restaurant called Clark’s that has good breakfast. Anyways, yesterday, I was researching how to style the minima theme for Jekyll, and I came across someone’s jekyll blog.
<a href="https://blog.slowb.ro/mailcow-email-migration-from-postfix-dovecot-spamassassin/">Slowbro Blog</a>.
This is Slowbro Blog, a blog owned by someone with a lot more experience than me.
Anyways, this blog post (linked above) talks about a <em> dockerized working-out-of-the-box email service</em>. Better words have never been read. I have struggled for some time now trying to set up my own email server on my one server. (my one server is an old PC someone gave me which actually quite good at running Docker containers but nothing else). I read through the documentation and it seems quite simple. Today, I’ll just apply some updates to my server and setup the docker-compose file. Hopefully, all goes well. 
If I get it up and running by today, I’ll post again.</p>
