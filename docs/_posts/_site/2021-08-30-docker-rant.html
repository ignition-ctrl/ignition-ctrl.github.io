<h1>Docker is Awesome (Another Rant)</h1>

<p>I just love Docker. I don’t know why. It’s the normie in me. There’s a desire for things to just work. A desire for something to do something well and conveniently.
Docker just works, and it’s awesome. Now, I know that just pulling docker containers is taking the fun out of installing packages and managing config files, but I like how quickly things go.
No more waiting for things to compile or researching the documentation, you can just set an environment variable or two and let the container do its magic. 
Of course, the more complex the container is, the more work is required. The docker-compose file for my *arr stack is convoluted, to say the least. 
I am just a big fan of it, the fact that containers are so easy to maintain, update, and manage. 
For example, I just did somthing today incredibly easily. 
I set up a komga ODPS server and downloaded 200~ comics. Now, I can use an ODPS client and read all of my preferred comics on the go. It was pretty simple.
All I had to do was run a compose file for Komga. Here’s mine</p>

<p>version: ‘3.3’
services:
  komga:
    image: gotson/komga
    container_name: komga
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./komga/config
        target: /config
      - type: bind
        source: /mnt/comics
        target: /data
      - type: bind
        source: /etc/timezone
        target: /etc/timezone
        read_only: true
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    user: “1000:1000”
    #environment:
            #      - <ENV_VAR>=<extra configuration="">
    restart: unless-stopped</extra></ENV_VAR></p>

<p>Simple, mostly copied from the github page. 
Then, I used another docker container called “comic_dl” which allowed me to download entire comics from sites like readcomicsonline.li.
comic_dl only downloads jpgs (thankfully, in numbered order) and komga accepts pdfs not jpgs. So, just use some imagemagick. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert *.jpg comic.pdf</code>. 
Now, all I do is write a simple Bash script which uses takes a link, downloads the jpgs, converts them into a pdf, and removes the originals. 
However, copy and pasting hundreds of links from readcomicsonline.li would be annoying. If only there was some way to extract info from a website in an automated manner…</p>

<p>I used a python script, which (with some vim editing) provided an entire list of links that I could download.
So, I just let it run and it downloaded a ton of files, nicely formatted for komga, and komga takes care of the rest. 
That’s why I love docker.
Because with docker, I can do a lot more</p>
