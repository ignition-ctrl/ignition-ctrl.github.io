Hello, sorry I haven't been posting. I've been busy learning! I've helped write a Python API Library (exciting stuff), add a few docker containers (Jellyfin is great!), and rice my computer a bit.
I used to run i3-gaps, but I wanted to try a non-tiling WM or DE. I installed KDE which, while a little bloated for my taste, was very nice. Tinkered with the themes and Konsole. 
However, I wanted to give Openbox another try. I had tried Openbox before, but did not realize how to use it. I was confused by the black screen and the only menu being the right click.
I customized the rc.xml file to add the familiar i3 bindings. Added a nice looking polybar, and made it look like this!.

I also watched <em>Serial Experiments Lain</em> which was very enlightening. Big fan. 
I'll add a few more posts detailing what I've done. However, I may just abandon this blog, and keep everything on my brand new deepdepths.online.
I'm getting sick of adding more *.deepdepths.online dns records. See you later
