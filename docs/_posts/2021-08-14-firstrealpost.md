So, this is my first real post on Jekyll. I'm learning the basics of Jekyll and Github Pages. 
I already wrote some bash scripts to automate the posting process and the pushing to Github. I'm actually feeling quite tired. 
My head isn't working at full capacity. I didn't get great sleep last night and I spent all day learning this. My brother's watchin TV, I might as well join him.
I don't know how Vim lines work. If I write on a line for too long, does Jekyll auto reformat it? I'll figure out tomorrow.
