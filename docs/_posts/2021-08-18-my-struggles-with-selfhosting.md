Trying to set up a homelab is hard when you don't have any income and you're the only one who knows what you're talking about. I managed to get my father's old PC to convert it into a Linux server. Before, I had only used WSL and Linode servers. I watched a NetworkChuck video (in which he says you can get a Linode server free for a year <em>which is false</em>) and decided to get a Linode server. I only used it to get familiar with Linux, and now I mostly work on my dualbooting 8-year old laptop. Still, the old PC is useful. It's the first pure Linux machine I got. I started running some docker containers on it and it worked perfectly. Except for Plex. It's way too old for Plex.
