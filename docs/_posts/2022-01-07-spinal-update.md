So, I haven't updated in a while, and now it's the New Year. 2022. I'm trying to make a lot of changes in my life, just like everyone in January. I've changed my domain name to spinal.top, so hopes are that you are seeing this at blog.spinal.top. My server crashed, but it gave me an opportunity to reorganize my system in a better and more efficient way. For example, I'm not using Apache, I've switched to Nginx. Nginx is actually much simpler especially if you need a good reverse proxy. So glad I switched. Nginx's system also means I can have all my services under the spinal.top domain, instead as subdomains. Reinstalled Linux Mint on my laptop, removed the lightdm bloat and used [nullgemm's ly display manager](https://github.com/nullgemm/ly) which is much faster, as it is just a TUI. My system now boots up much faster (1 minute~ to 20 seconds). Since my server crashed, I'm using my laptop as a replacement until I figure out how to fix it. It's a hardware problem which makes it complicated. Anyways, that's all for now.
