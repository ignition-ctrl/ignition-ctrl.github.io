Fun, but tiring. Yet, also relaxing at the same time. Anyways, today I managed to configure LightDM so that it would autostart i3-gaps on login. I also put an Alena Aenami wallpaper on it. Her work is very beautiful and will always be my wallpapers (unless I find something better which I doubt). This is the wallpaper in question.

&lt;p&gt;This is actually my first time putting an image in a Jekyll post. Hopefully, it renders right. I’m off on my way to the city, I’ll see you guys tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zack</name></author><category term="placeholder" /><summary type="html">So, I forgot to post yesterday because I went tubing with my family.

I’m learning the basics of Jekyll and Github Pages. 
I already wrote some bash scripts to automate the posting process and the pushing to Github. I’m actually feeling quite tired. 
My head isn’t working at full capacity. I didn’t get great sleep last night and I spent all day learning this. My brother’s watchin TV, I might as well join him.
I don’t know how Vim lines work. If I write on a line for too long, does Jekyll auto reformat it? I’ll figure out tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zack</name></author><category term="posts" /><summary type="html">So, this is my first real post on Jekyll.
