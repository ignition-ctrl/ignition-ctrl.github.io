&lt;p&gt;Trying to set up a homelab is hard when you don’t have any income and you’re the only one who knows what you’re talking about. I managed to get my father’s old PC to convert it into a Linux server. Before, I had only used WSL and Linode servers. I watched a NetworkChuck video (in which he says you can get a Linode server free for a year &lt;em&gt;which is false&lt;/em&gt;) and decided to get a Linode server. I only used it to get familiar with Linux, and now I mostly work on my dualbooting 8-year old laptop. Still, the old PC is useful. It’s the first pure Linux machine I got. I started running some docker containers on it and it worked perfectly. Except for Plex. It’s way too old for Plex.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zack</name></author><category term="placeholder" /><summary type="html">Trying to set up a homelab is hard when you don’t have any income and you’re the only one who knows what you’re talking about.

&lt;p&gt;Good morning, everyone. So, I forgot to post yesterday again. I spent all day at the Big Apple. Very fun, there’s a restaurant called Clark’s that has good breakfast. Anyways, yesterday, I was researching how to style the minima theme for Jekyll, and I came across someone’s jekyll blog.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.slowb.ro/mailcow-email-migration-from-postfix-dovecot-spamassassin/&quot;&gt;Slowbro Blog&lt;/a&gt;.
This is Slowbro Blog, a blog owned by someone with a lot more experience than me.
Anyways, this blog post (linked above) talks about a &lt;em&gt; dockerized working-out-of-the-box email service&lt;/em&gt;. Better words have never been read. I have struggled for some time now trying to set up my own email server on my one server. (my one server is an old PC someone gave me which actually quite good at running Docker containers but nothing else). I read through the documentation and it seems quite simple. Today, I’ll just apply some updates to my server and setup the docker-compose file. Hopefully, all goes well. 
If I get it up and running by today, I’ll post again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zack</name></author><category term="posts," /><category term="app-review" /><summary type="html">Good morning, everyone.

&lt;p&gt;So, I forgot to post yesterday because I went tubing with my family. Fun, but tiring. Yet, also relaxing at the same time. Anyways, today I managed to configure LightDM so that it would autostart i3-gaps on login. I also put an Alena Aenami wallpaper on it. Her work is very beautiful and will always be my wallpapers (unless I find something better which I doubt). This is the wallpaper in question.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/aenami-wallpapers/alena-aenami-where-we-were.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alena-aenami-where-we-were&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually my first time putting an image in a Jekyll post. Hopefully, it renders right. I’m off on my way to the city, I’ll see you guys tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zack</name></author><category term="placeholder" /><summary type="html">So, I forgot to post yesterday because I went tubing with my family.

&lt;p&gt;So, this is my first real post on Jekyll. I’m learning the basics of Jekyll and Github Pages. 
I already wrote some bash scripts to automate the posting process and the pushing to Github. I’m actually feeling quite tired. 
My head isn’t working at full capacity. I didn’t get great sleep last night and I spent all day learning this. My brother’s watchin TV, I might as well join him.
I don’t know how Vim lines work. If I write on a line for too long, does Jekyll auto reformat it? I’ll figure out tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zack</name></author><category term="posts" /><summary type="html">So, this is my first real post on Jekyll.
