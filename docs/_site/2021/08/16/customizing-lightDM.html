<p>So, I forgot to post yesterday because I went tubing with my family. Fun, but tiring. Yet, also relaxing at the same time. Anyways, today I managed to configure LightDM so that it would autostart i3-gaps on login. I also put an Alena Aenami wallpaper on it. Her work is very beautiful and will always be my wallpapers (unless I find something better which I doubt). This is the wallpaper in question.

<p>This is actually my first time putting an image in a Jekyll post. Hopefully, it renders right. I’m off on my way to the city, I’ll see you guys tomorrow.</p>
