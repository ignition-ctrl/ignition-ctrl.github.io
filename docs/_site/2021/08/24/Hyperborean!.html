<meta name="description" content="Hyperborean! So, I’m spending a short vacation in Canada! Having fun up here. I’ve always liked the cold. Anyways, in more interesting news, I’m considering doing the switch to Nginx. I’ve always used Apache2 for my webserver, but now it’s feeling outdated. I know it’s not outdated but the syntax for Nginx seems more modern. It’s also much more lightweight, and it would run better on my ancient server. I can even just use nginx proxy manager as a container, since all I’m really using Apache for is as a reverse proxy. Nginx, however, is the more recommended reverse proxy, and I would like to use it for the future. I am afraid of the change though. I have multiple configuration files, and I would have to rewrite them in nginx. I hate repeating myself. I know though it’s probably for the best. There’s also just the option of setting up nginx as a reverse proxy in docker-compose. I would have to combine all the docker-compose files in one giant one. This way, I can just add different networks for different services (or I guess I could keep them all in one) and have traefik or nginx manage them. Traefik seems interesting, but difficult. Its website says otherwise but I don’t trust what I’ve read. Also, I’m afraid of breaking the compose files by merging them. It would be nice though. Anyways, I’ll keep any readers posted.
