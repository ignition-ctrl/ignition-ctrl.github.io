Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Zack, and I'm currently just a student. I love learning about Linux and Python. I would like to become a Linux Sysadmin. I also enjoy working with Docker containers.
My blog here is just to let me talk about what I've done for the day and get it all right in my head. I don't expect anyone to actually read it as I'm not advertising my site or anything. If you do come across this site, I hope it proves interesting!
